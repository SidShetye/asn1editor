ASN.1 Editor
============

This is a fork of the Code Project article at http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/4910/ASN-Editor.

I am NOT the original author; the original author is Liping Dai (http://www.codeproject.com/Members/Liping-Dai)

I've put this here for anyone wanting to conveniently browse the source as well as to have a working backup in case the original Code project article (now almost 10 years old) goes down

Changes
-------

* Migrated to VS2015
* Asn1EditorSetup is an older visual studio project type that's now obsolete
* Added license file to repo
